# Stray Kids Photocards Database

This project is a database for Stray Kids Photocards, where users can browse and search for photocards based on different categories such as member, album, version, and type. The project uses MongoDB as the database, and it was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). Additionally, several libraries and frameworks were implemented, including Bootstrap for styling, Nodemailer for email functionality, Bcrypt for password encryption, SweetAlert2 for alerts and notifications, and Multer for handling file uploads.

## Usage
